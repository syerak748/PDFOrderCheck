# PDFOrderCheck
For firms providing large services. There is a mainframe which is used to compile all relevant forms and docs in a single pdf which is then sent to the customer or stored in their database after receiving from the customer. The compiled PDF's various sub segments should follow the same order as defined in a spreadsheet. After compilation, the order is checked manually one by one for each compiled PDF. \
This python scripts automates the testing process and suggests adequate changes to correct the order if ANY. 
This is how the initial pdf and reference sheet looks :\
